            <h2>Strange, yet beautiful.</h2>
            <h2>Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I’ve always wanted to know who I am. I think this is what’s fueled my constant desire for new experiences, constant learning and deep conversations. However, what I realize is that I’ve been exhibiting my values throughout my life while meeting new people, going new places and experiencing new things. I have an insatiable curiosity that guides my daily actions. I have a desire to leave my mark on this world. I wish to be kind to others, and teach others to be kind in the process. I wish to spread peace and love while learning, travelling and exploring the intricacies of this planet we call earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is up to you to decide if I’ve done that. All I can do is try my best.
                </p>
            <h2>Curiosity</h2>
                <h3>
                    “Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced” - Soren Kierkegaard.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Curiosity, the process of asking questions and searching for answers, cannot be conducted behind screens in our rooms. A lot of the time the answers don’t even exist. Many times we learn we’ve been asking the wrong questions to begin with. I don’t want to live with a chip on my shoulder, I don’t want to live in fear of making mistakes. After all there are no wrong answers, only decisions and consequences, only here and now. This isn’t always the easiest to remember, but that struggle in itself is my experience of reality. Once again, all I can do is try my best.

            <h2>Where I am now</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m living on Miyakojima, an island part of the Ryukyuan archipelago currently governed by Japan. As this blog is more of a personal journal than anything else, I will also have posts about my experiences and daily life learning about the unique culture and history of this island as I experience all the things anyone does when they live somewhere; friendships, hardships, happiness and triumphs.
                </p>
            <h2>Trying new things</h2>
            <p>
                Finally I love learning new skills, which is one of the largest inspirations in me making this blog. I hope to share with you my journey as I learn about taking better photos, website development techniques and so on. I hope you follow me on my journey, as I live my daily life trying my best at being the person I want to be, whatever that is.

    <h2>
        Cathartic emotional emo/post-hardcore/post-rock to get you through 2025 and the next 4 years to come
    </h2>
    <p>
        “Take me onto a dirt road, Crack the neck of the wheel, And let us fly into the densest forest there is, Because I can’t build the courage to do it myself”
    </p>
    <p>
        Pretty apt. intro to this song and the whole album I’d say.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the debut album from Ohio Emo/Post-Hardcore group Bee Hive Ski Race. From the get-go it is unapologetically noisy, emotional, angry, confused and under it all absolutely full of love and passion, this album is full of catharsis that many may need to help them get through 2025 (me included).
    </p>
    <p>
        This album dances around different hardcore genres beautifully while still maintaining a cohesive and unique identity, something that is incredibly rare for a debut record. It has songs featuring dizzying noisy feedback (Gish Gallop), loud fuzzed out guitars with soaring clean vocals (Glittter), Blistering, fun and fast guitar riffs (1.4.0/1.12.1), incredible post-rock swells (exhibitionism), and holding it all together is the INCREDIBLE vocal performance from Katie Blackburn. Her vocal style is so unique, raw and passionate, while still being quite versatile. She can soar, she can glue a track together, she can scream. She has this ability to pull a previous phrase into the next one, or match the intensity of a build up with a cathartic scream that makes her vocal style sound so free yet controlled, almost reminiscent of the way Adam Duritz from Counting Crows bounces around and moans in ways that fit in perfectly with the band and drive a track forward, except she’s screaming and varying her intensity to fit the mood of the moment.

        I have to talk about what is possibly one of my favorite songs released in a long time, “Entomological Field Research”. This song contrasts what we go through during life, pain, love, perseverance, identity, change, compassion and contrasts it with a government, a ruling class, a media that tells us we’re no more than insects. These people writing checks to level homes in Gaza, approving genocide, using child labor in Africa produce media to convince us to hate each other and hate ourselves. I would be remiss to mention that this dynamic is being explored through Katie Blackburn’s experiences as someone who is part of the LGBTQ+ community. She speaks out in the beginning of the song stating “My mother got hate in the mail when I came out at 18/She fought for me harder than I ever did myself/I struggle to think they win when I go avoidant/I struggle when half of my peers want me burning in hell”. For a long time LGBTQ+ people have been the center of unwanted attention, hate and discrimination. Recently with Trump being president hate groups and hateful people have felt even more empowered to discriminate than in the past. It’s one thing to read about it in the media and turn the other cheek, but I have so many friends who have been targeted for just being themselves and it’s so scary. These lyrics do a beautiful job of painting and really humanizing this reality.
    </p>

        She goes onto explore this theme of an intense desire for change in a crumbling world stating “If change could happen I would change it you know/But a decaying collective doesn’t help me at all”. Then she wraps it back around to the theme of being a bug. A bug writhing under the light of a magnifying glass. We are the insects writhing, and we are the light making ourselves squirm in pain as the rich and wealthy hold the glass that manipulates us.

        Of course these incredibly vulnerable and powerful lyrics are delivered in a cohesive body of work with lightning fast guitar riffs, blistering vocals and a break pedal that the band is not afraid to slam on, tightening your body on the seatbelt as your inertia comes to a halt. And just as you get used to your new speed they put the gas back on and start accelerating into breakneck speeds. It’s fun, it’s powerful, it’s raw and it’s catchy.
    </p>

        This song is followed by “Glittter”, slowing it down a little bit with shimmering guitars and soaring clean vocals. We’re instantly pulled out of the decaying world and reminded to live in the moment and appreciate what we have. We are reminded of the healing power of nature, and spending time with loved ones as Katie sings “I watched the Aurora celestial light/I stood with my mother/the day turned to night/I swear that the colors would saturate/Some of this adversity did start to fade”. One of my favorite tracks. Especially in the context of the album it has a powerful effect, reminding us how we can all stay sane in the crazy.
    </p>

        Gish Gallop is insane. It uses distorted fuzzed out guitars and Katie’s increasingly chaotic vocals as she speaks of the life of someone seemingly being driven crazy by the monotony of everyday life. It builds up and builds up until the character seemingly finally decides to do something about it but discovers his old body can’t move the way it used to. They mutter about their praxis and bad shoulder while the whining guitars grow louder and louder. Incredibly noise rock song that does a great job of breaking up the flow of the album.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ll then talk about 1.4.0/1.12.1. I think the song is one of Katie’s best vocal performances. She emotionally jumps between screaming and singing and talking in a way that feels so natural and cathartic. She screams to blistering fast guitar riffs broken up by sections of heavy trudging power chords. It closes with Katie slowly singing over a noisy slowed version of the main riff. The lyrics here seem to be looking back on a separated relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then continues with some heavy rock bangers that bring us to Hurricane. Hurricane has some of the most emotional lyrics and screaming from Katie. The song features some more fast post-hardcore riffs, channeling At-The-Drive-In while Katie screams viscerally about how she’d give anything to a long distance loved-one. It’s hard not to feel the intensity of the emotion with strong lyrics like “given the chance I would break my legs, suffocate, to ease it just a little bit”. It closes with some swelling heavy wha guitars in a powerful post-rock vibe.
    </p>

        The album closes with Heifer. A slow build ominous piece about the genocide in Gaza. She speaks of “soft power over me” speaking about how the influence of the US government and their relationship with Israel is forcing a number of countries and people to turn a blind eye. However she refers to “a city on a hill”. This line had been used by Jesus as well as various American historical figures. Jesus used it to refer to how Christians shine with a light that must be unhidden. Reagan used it to refer to how America is looked up to by various other nations. The common theme being that a city on a hill cannot hide. Israel and America’s true colors are on the world’s stage for the world to see. Katie also mentions “paving over graves for golden streets”. This album was released before Trump's statements about his desire to turn Gaza into the “Riviera of The Middle East” and essentially erase Palestine off of the face of the earth. The line is quite eerie in modern context, but I thought it was worth mentioning. The song slows down as Katie lowers her voice to the lines “Mediated by pontius plans/The city’s a ruin/A no-man’s land/No valleys, no peaks/Just a pustulant scar/On the hands of the meek”. She closes it out, blaming the ones who were in a position to act and didn’t, the unaffected bystanders watching and doing nothing.

        Those were some of my highlights from the album. Overall it is an incredible listen that deserves more attention, and voices the frustrations and fears of many as Trump continues to make the US a more fearful place, as well as provides bursts of compassion, love and hope, telling us how to live and find short moments of calm in the insanity.

                I get asked often why I decided to come to Japan. The surface answer I generally give is “to learn the language” or “to learn the culture” or “I’m only 23 and I want some adventure”. None of these are false, but when I sit and think about it none of them are really correct either.

                Ever since I can remember, I’ve been a wonderer. I do believe in fate, and I do believe in destiny. However, the beauty in life lies not in creating our own destiny or shaping the world to our desires. Life is about discovering, wondering and experiencing. We are here to discover what our fate is, wonder about the workings of the world and, if we’re lucky, discover anything about this universe.

                This way of thinking was brought to me by the eastern philosophy interpreter and orator Alan Watts. However, I’ve always been obsessed with roots. I discovered his lectures through a band called “Nothing More” who sampled him in their music. I then went on to listen to some of his lectures, and discovered that he is more of an interpreter and less of a thinker. Where did he get these ideas from? Who came up with them first?

                This is when I discovered that these ideas were not American. They weren’t even Greek or Roman or French. He interpreted the ideas of those from the Eastern Hemisphere. What he said was more common to the teachings of Laozi, Gandhi or Buddhas. As a wonderer, I was enthralled. I had spent so much time absorbing easily digestible and easily found teachings of stoic philosophers such as Marcus Aurelius or Epictetus, or the Absurdist teachings of Albert Camus (among many others). To learn that there’s not just a whole world of thought, but a whole number of worlds of thought, entire cultures of people who operate and live life differently than me was beyond incredible. I wanted to learn what I could; I wanted adventure and experience. I wanted to explore the entirety of the sliver of the universe that I’d been granted, even if it is just a sliver. To me that sliver is the entire world, and the world has only felt larger and larger the longer I live.

                So here I am, embarking on my journey, exploring the world and diving into the corners of it that peak my interest. On my journey I’ve learned so much, maybe more about myself than anything else.

                This blog is yet another journey I will be embarking on. I’m sure I’ll learn much about websites, coding and such as I create it, but I also hope to learn about writing and organizing ideas. I hope to learn about creating aesthetics.

                I would be remiss to not mention who inspired this blog. I have many friends and family back home who want to keep up with my life here in Miyakojima, how I’m doing and what my experiences are like! I’m sure most of them are currently the primary (or only) readers of this blog, so thanks so much to them for pushing me (whether they know it or not) to start this project. You know who you are, family and friends, and I love all of you and am always looking forward to the day I see you next (wherever that may be).
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally I would like to mention that most blog posts in the future will contain more specific experiences that I go through, with more specific musings of differences in my daily life here as well as cultural differences I observe. That is to say, the content most people come to this blog for. I just wanted to make my first post a small in depth into why I started blogging, and a short background as to the perspective I will be writing from.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope you all live peacefully and happily

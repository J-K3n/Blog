            About Sanshin (三線)
        </h3>
        <p>
            This is the first of probably many coming posts detailing the story behind some Ryukyuan folk songs! I’m currently learning the sanshin, a traditional Okinawan instrument, so I sometimes perform songs with my group.
        </p>
        <p>
            For anyone who doesn’t know, sanshin is a traditional Okinawan instrument and a predecessor to the Shamisen in Japan. Here is a picture of mine! I bought it this month.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Japanese it is written 三線 which means “three lines” or “three strings”. As you probably could have guessed, it is a three stringed instrument. The strings tend to be made out of nylon, while the body is almost entirely wood with either a snake skin covering, or an artificial snake skin covering. Habu is a word used in Okinawa to refer to various breeds of poisonous snakes that are local to the islands. These snakes being native to these islands are why it is traditional to make the body of the sanshin out of snake skin.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are lots of traditional folk songs played on the sanshin. Since the Ryukyu islands are relatively spread out, it allowed for different languages and cultures to develop on each island. This includes music. While each island uses the same sanshin, each island has their own folk songs written in their own languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of the songs I have been learning in my group are Miyako folk songs, however one song I will share with you is a Miyako folk song while the other is an Okinawan main island song.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was my second time performing Sanshin! I haven’t done a solo performance yet (I’m still learning, and the words to songs are really hard to memorize), so this was a group performance with the group I had been learning with. We wore traditional Japanese coats called “happi”. They were lent to us for free. We didn’t get to be very picky with the sizes so mine looks like a bit of an apron.
        </p>
        <p>
            The event I’m performing at is a community center festival. In Miyako (and all across Japan) adults enjoy participating in circles (or clubs) where they practice various cultural activities such as sanshin, shamisen, dance and so on. (There are sports, knitting, drinking and outdoor activity circles as well!) While we were warming up in the practice room next to the stage, I remember seeing various outfits and lots of different people preparing their own performances of different songs and dances. We waited as each group went out and performed until it was our turn.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was my second time performing sanshin, but I really enjoyed walking out on the stage. I already knew I didn’t fit in, but people tend to be impressed and have a lot of gratitude to outsiders making real efforts to learn their culture. I wondered what people in the audience thought about me. But I felt good standing next to the people I meet with every week, knowing that we practiced and prepared for that moment.

        <h3>
            Mazunuara 米ぬあら
        </h3>
        <p>
            The first song we performed was Mazunuara, or ます゜ぬあら in Miyako or 米のあら in Japanese. For anyone who speaks Japanese, you will notice that the second hiragana is a character that doesn’t exist in the Japanese alphabet. It is used to represent a sound that has been described to me as an in between of a z sound and a j sound. Kind of like a French je but not quite.
        </p>
        <p>
            The song's lyrics tell the story of a person who is missing his lover while he works all day in the fields. Eventually, by the end of the song, the person sings that since they have not seen their lover in a long time, he is starting to forget her. Here is an English transcription of the Miyako lyrics so that you can follow along to the verses. I’ll also provide rough English translations underneath each line.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYoIEDzYg24">Here is a link to a performance of the song</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Mazunu ara you i kuminuyu arayo irabi nyaan yuyanaure <br>
Farming rice, just like farming rice
        </p>
        <p>
            Irabiyaukiyou i suusuuriya utsu yo agutumaina yuyanaure <br>
            Select and pull out
        </p>
        <p>
            Pituyugapanariyou i katayuga nutsu yo shirariunna yuyanaure <br>
            Even though it’s just the first night, even for a moment I don’t want to be separated
        </p>
        <p>
            Pituyuunduyou i mumutinu inmai yo tsutsu yamuna yuyanaure <br>
            It seems that a hundred year bond can be created in one night
        </p>
        <p>
            Futayunnayou i ifutinu innuga yo tsukadigara yuyanaure <br>
            How many bonds can be created in two nights
        </p>
        <p>
            Pituyutimidakarayou i tukayupatsuka yo myuunshaku yuyanaore <br>
            If we don’t meet for one night, maybe we won’t meet for 10 or 20
        </p>
        <p>
            Futayutimidakarayou i kayutazu ntsumai yo mamigishaku yanaure
            If we don’t meet for two nights, I will forget the path that I had been walking
        </p>
        <p>
            (disclaimer, I speak very little to no Miyako language. This is my rough translation of a Japanese translation I found. It is incomplete but the best I can do and I want you guys to be able to follow the meaning somewhat)
        </p>
        <h3>
            Asadoyayunta 安里屋ユンタ
        </h3>
        <p>
            The second song we sang is called Asadoyayunta, or 安里屋ユンタ in Japanese. It is much easier to find details about this song since it is from the Okinawa main Island and much more popular. Here are the lyrics to the song in romaji (transcription of Japanese words into the English alphabet) with lyric translations underneath so you can follow!
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is a link to a performance of the song. <br>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOwcHWiX8rY">This one has all the verses</a> <br>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J43yvF5BI6A">This one is missing some verses but I like this performance more</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sa kimi wa nonaka no ibara no hanaka (sa yui yui) kuretekaereba yarehonni hikitomeru mataharinu tsundara kanushamayo <br>
            Are you a thorny flower in the middle of the field? You stop me when I try to go home.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sa ureshihazukashi ukina wo tatete (sa yui yui) nushi wa shirayuri yarehonni mamanaranu mataharinu tsundara kanushamayo <br>
            A happy and embarrassing story of a love affair brews. Like a white lily, I cannot control you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sa tagusa torunara izayoi tzukiyo (sa yui yui) futaride kiganemo yarehonni mizu irazu mataharinu tsundara kanushamayo <br>
            We watch the full moon as we pick the weeds. We can be alone here together without any worries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sa someteagemasho konji no kosode (sa yui yui) kaketeokureyo nasakenotasuki mataharinu tsundara kanushamayo <br>
            I’ll dye it for you, your navy kosode. Place the tasuki filled with compassion over my shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sa Okinawa yoitoko ichido wa mensore (sa yui yui) haru natsu aki fuyu midori no shimayo mataharinu tsundara kanushamayo <br>
            Okinawa is a wonderful place, so welcome! It’s a green island in spring, summer, fall and winter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notes: The Mataharinu tsundara kanushamayo at the end of each line is in Okinawan language. The translation I found online says there are multiple theories of what “mataharinu” can mean, one of them possibly being “a day with clear skies”. Tsundara, however, means “pitiful” while “kanushama” can be translated as “my beloved” or “lover” specifically said from a man to a woman. So every phrase ends with “my pitiful beloved”.
        </p>
        <h3>
            After the performance
        </h3>
        <p>
            To be honest when I performed I fumbled through a bit of the words, but I hope that by doing translations and interacting with the songs more I can continue to try and commit them to memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            After we performed we went to a restaurant to eat and talk and drink together. Miyako, it seems, is a temporary location for many. Two of the older women in our circle were only here temporarily for work, so it was likely the last time I would be performing with them. Many others I meet in Miyako say they got a job in the tourism industry here to temporarily get away from busy life on main island Japan, or to enjoy the beaches of Miyako before they get a more permanent job. Even kids who lived their whole lives here must leave, at least temporarily, to attend university since there are none on the island.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, for those who are curious, here is the book I have of Miyako folk songs. The notation used to read is native to Okinawa and called Kunkunshi. After I have the kunkunshi of a song called Honen no Uta, or Song of a Bountiful Year. On the left is each verse of the song and on the right is the notation of the song that is the same for each verse.

            Anyway, I hope you enjoyed reading about these Okinawa and Miyako folk songs! There will definitely be more content like this in the future as I continue to learn songs on the sanshin. If you enjoyed the content and want to be notified when I upload again, you can find a singup box on the homepage to be added to may mailing list!

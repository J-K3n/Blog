                Or Happy new years! This standard Japanese new year greeting that roughly translates to “Congratulations on opening the new year! I’m looking forward to working with you this year too”

                I have this problem. And this problem is plaguing the start of this blog, and some other hobbies I have. It may be perfectionism, but essentially I stack my plate too high. I get all these ideas of what I should do and ultimately it becomes too daunting and I never even start it. However, I started this blog so I would like to carry the momentum. I would also like to use it as an opportunity to publish things that may be imperfect, to try and overcome this problem. I still think people will enjoy it and I’ll be proud of it though. It’s a hobby and a journey, so why take it too seriously?
            </p>
            <p>
                So what does that mean for this post and coming posts? I think they will be more reflective in nature, and very informal. Hopefully they get better with time, but there’s no reason to rush getting better at these things because it’s just for fun. So in this post, in the spirit of the new year, I’d like to share some of my favorite moments from the past year. Maybe in another post I’ll share my goals and aspirations for this coming year (maybe I won’t if I can’t find time for it).

                I guess I’ll start with what started this year, my last semester of college. I spent a lot of this semester working on applications to programs like JET, worrying about what I’ll do for work after college, and working as much as possible for Belmont MPAC Crew (stage crew for student recitals and events on campus). I spent plenty of time with friends too. But in many ways, for me, it was the end of that chapter of my life.

                So to mark an end to what had been an incredible part of my life, I graduated college. In this picture are some of my best friends that made my college experience what it was. I am forever thankful for them. I hope anywhere we meet again we can share in the friendship again that guided us all through the beginning of our adult lives. In many ways I still feel like a kid when I’m with them, a way that maybe I didn’t even feel like when I was a kid. That feeling is the feeling of looking at the world without judgement, and with eyes open excited to experience, learn and see more. It is thanks to these friends that friendship holds the intense meaning that it does to me today. I hope everyone gets to experience having friends like these, and to these friends that I had I want you all to know I am incredibly grateful just for you being you. I am rooting for all of you in whatever you think success for yourself is. From Japan, I wish you all well.

                In this next photo is my brothers at a campfire at our yearly family golf outing (sorry you look a little crazy David). Looking at this photo I’m able to remind myself of a few things. One is how important family is to me. I think the only reason I’ve been able to achieve all that I have is because I learned from my parents and brothers what unconditional love is. I learned what it is to live in a small community, what it means to make mistakes, apologize and forgive growing up in a house of 6 (7 including tha dawg). At this golf outing, and everytime I see my brothers and family I’m reminded of how cool they all are and how much they’re all able to achieve. I think all of that begins with the unconditional love we were raised with, which has allowed us to make mistakes and grow together. Reese, Brennan, David I love you guys. To you guys too, well wishes from Japan (but I know you’ll do incredible things without it anyway).
            </p>
            <p>
                I also am reminded of what it means to connect with others through music. Whether it's a song that everyone knows, or just watching someone perform; music is an awesome force in this world that brings people together. I hope to carry that and connect with others through music as I move forward in life.

                Now it’s time for a few photos from my trip to Italy! I was supposed to go to Italy back in 2020 but I think we all know why it didn’t happen then. I’m happy it got delayed anyway because I was able to go with my brother and my mom! I always find what’s most important about these trips is spending meaningful time exploring the world with people who are important to us. It also lets us see better how others take in new experiences and see the world. It always brings about some fun and amazing conversations, and I wouldn’t have preferred to spend my time in Italy with anyone else.

                For saying all of this I really don’t have a lot of pictures with family out in Italy, but I did take some amazing pictures of some truly breathtaking places I visited. These two pictures are from Cinque Terre, the place I honestly was most excited to visit in Italy. Listed as a UNESCO world heritage site, it is a series of small towns and vineyards built into these beautifully green hills on the shore of the Mediterranean. We did a lot of hiking, and ate some of the best meals of my entire life. There’s just something wonderful about hiking all day and finishing it with a 4 course meal of fresh fish, pasta, dessert and wine. It makes it even all better when you do it with those you love.

                Here is a photo that comes with a lot of history for me personally. Growing up, my parents and grandparents told me a lot of my family history. A lot of that history I was incredibly fortunate to learn about through the relationship I had with my Great Grandma. My Great Grandma Florence was and will forever be one of the biggest inspirations in my life. I remember her telling me stories of growing up in Paris, France. They were courageous and inspiring stories of what it was like to move alone with her first child from Paris to Shawnee, Oklahoma. I remember visiting her house once a year. Every time she would grab me, give me la bise (a kiss on each cheek. It’s a normal greeting in France), and tell me how much I have grown.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember interviewing her for a foreign culture collage I had to make in Elementary school. I even interviewed her for a project I did about WW2 four years ago when I was a freshman in college. A lot of my favorite authors in middle school were French, and I studied French and hosted a French exchange student when I was in Highschool.
            </p>
            <p>
                So you’re probably thinking “ummmmm if she was French what does this have to do with Italy?” Well this has to do with just about my whole life to be honest. Meeting her and understanding my family history has rooted me deeper in understanding who I am and where I come from. In a lot of ways I have her to thank for my interest in languages and international studies as well. The location in this picture is a small villa just outside of Florence, where my Great Grandma was born, hence her name: Florence.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to do my best to remember her, especially her resilience and her kindness. I hope I can exhibit even a fraction of the strength of the woman I knew, and the strength of the woman she told me about in stories of when she was younger. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It feels especially appropriate to talk about here since 2024 is the year she passed away. I was upset that due to bad weather I wasn’t able to make it to her funeral. Instead I enjoyed a bottle of Alsatian Wine (Alsace is the region of France her family was originally from) with my friends and shared her stories. I’m proud to be her descendent.

                So, then my summer journey in Italy came to an end. But it was only the beginning of a completely new (and honestly much more exciting) journey. Before I had graduated I got accepted to the <a href="https://jetprogramme.org/en/">JET program</a>! It’s a program between Japan and various national governments to put native English speaking foreigners in Japanese schools. It’s to help increase the English speaking abilities of Japanese people as well as provide an opportunity for cultural exchange. In a world that is shrinking, exposing people to foreign concepts and ways of thinking, cultural exchange is a force that brings about understanding. And understanding brings peace. So I am honored to be placed in this position, and hope I can learn and grow from my experiences here.

                As well as have a lot of freaking fun! I’ve never worked with kids before and was quite worried about that. But they’re so fun and silly and non judgemental. I’m closer in age to a lot of my kids than some teachers I work with here so I tend to actually have more in common with them. I talk with them about music, memes, popular slang, hobbies and so on. I think I’m a lifelong learner and I learned this year that teaching doesn’t only mean you share information and lecture kids, but it also means to be a force for learning in an environment full of learners.

                This is a picture of the Aragusuku beach on the gorgeous Island of Miyako I got placed on. It’s a remote island in the Okinawa prefecture with a lot of unique indigenous culture and beautiful scenery. I’m sure next year I’ll get plenty of chances to write about what I’ve learned about this beautiful corner of the world. This beach is where I went snorkeling and saw turtles for the first time!

                Here’s a picture of my first ever lesson! It’s a class of 3rd years, and I’m giving them a self-introduction presentation. I laugh a little bit looking at this picture just remembering how scared I was to start teaching. I’m not a very talkative person, and I like things to be planned well, so leading a class, speaking to kids in a language they don’t understand for 50 minutes was pretty nerve-racking. I was also nervous to approach kids, walk up to their desks and correct them or ask them about what they were working on. Now I confidently lead about four 50 minute classes a day. I’m not a veteran teacher by any means, but I can at least confidently lead a class. And I’m wayyy more comfortable in front of my students in general.

                There are so many differences between Japanese and American schools the list could go on for hours. The two things that stand out to me in this picture are the uniforms and how the students are arranged. Uniforms aren’t a shock at all. Kids often think they’re cute or cool and aren’t really bothered by them. This may be a countryside Miyako thing, but kids are also allowed to dress in their PE uniforms most daysl if they think normal uniforms aren’t comfortable.
            </p>
            <p>
                And then how the students are arranged. In America students have lockers and teachers have classrooms. In Japan students have an assigned classroom, desk, chair and number for the entire school year. The point of this is to put students in charge of things. They’re responsible for the cleanliness, before class preparations and overall social atmosphere of the class. If I write something on the chalkboard, the students erase it after. If I need whiteboards for their class, I tell the students how many I need and they go get them for me. They even turn the projector on for me if it’s off. I more or less “visit” their classrooms that they take care of. Oh, schools don’t have janitors either; cleanliness is entirely up to the teachers and students. They have special time allocated (usually right after lunch and right after the final class period) to clean their classrooms and the school. Teachers help out as well. Since I’m a visitor at all of my schools I’m never asked to help, and I find their process is so organized I just get in the way if I try anyway.

                Unfortunately there’s so much I did and this post is already so long so here will be the last picture. This is a picture of all the other English teachers in Miyako, all a part of the JET program that I’m on. This, as you can probably tell, is our halloween party. If it weren’t for these people, I think I might’ve gone insane, and adjusting to life here would’ve been way more difficult. They help me when I have communication issues with teachers, complaints about unexpected work thrown at me, needing to get a bank account and so much more. They’ve also all introduced me to so many festivals, beautiful sights and opportunities to deepen my cultural experience on this island. I have them to thank really for how fun and relatively comfortable the transition from life in America to life in Japan has been. They could’ve been a group made of crazy random anybodies, but they prove to me constantly that they really care about the community of JETs that they’ve built and are willing to go above and beyond for those around them. I’m thankful to every single one of them and I look forward to the rest of our time in Miyako! 今年もよろしくお願いします！

                I hope to update this monthly! There will be a mix of updating posts and updating the aesthetic/usability of the website. I know it looks incredibly messy right now but I’m just now learning how to code, while working a full time job, while learning Japanese and trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. It will get better over time and I’m excited to be writing again and sharing my experiences with everyone!

                One more thing, here are all the backlogged photos I took but didn't publish/write about. In them are some photos of Miyako so enjoy!
